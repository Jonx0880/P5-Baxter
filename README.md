# P5-Baxter (AAU robotics, 5. semester)
This is the 5. semester project "Knowledge driven spoken language interface for industrial robotics manipulation based on Baxter Robot".
The project aims to create a language-interface based solution for assembly of the dummmy phone using the Baxter Robot. The language interface will be built using the Google Cloud speech API for capturing and recognizing audio stream. This input will be processed and used as commands in knowledge-driven decision making for the Baxter robot to assemble a dummy phone. For object detection of the dummy phone parts, a pre-trained YOLOv3 network will be used. Integration of these different methods for an overall solution can be found in this repository. Custom grippers and fixtures has also been made for this project.
